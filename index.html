          <p>
            We will have monthly meetups to share ideas and check on our progress.
            Each month will have an intermediate goal that we are hoping to demo for our goghbots.
            These plans are all tentative. We can speed up or slow down the schedule based on whether we are accomplishing the goals.

          <h2>Month 1: Assembly</h2>
          <p>
            Let's make get a basic rolling chassis with some sort of code loaded on it.
            If you are using the suggested starter kit this will mostly involve burning an SD card and getting an ssh terminal running on the raspberry pi.
            If you are doing your own robot design there might be a lot more work involved with getting a rolling chassis that you can run code on.

          <h2>Month 2: Remote Control</h2>
          <p>
            The goal here is to make sure we have code that can drive our robot at varying speeds and varying degrees of turn.
            The simplest way to experiment with this is to allow the robot to be driven remotely by a person.
            You can control it from a keyboard, by mouse movement, by gamepad or any other input device you want.

          <h2>Month 3: Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
          <p>
            Let's use some onboard sensors to avoid getting stuck.
            Our robots won't have any specific destination in mind, they should just be wandering and trying to avoid obstacles as they go.
            We'll use something like <a href="https://youtu.be/AkhHkr1Z7WM">a roombots maze</a> to  provide examples of obstacles.
            If there are othe obstacles you want to plan for please bring your own examples and we'll se what we can learn.

          <h2>Month 4: Dead Reckoning</h2>
          <p>
            We'll use some onboard sensors to try to track our own position.
            This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead reckoning</a>.
            One way to test this is to plan a route ahead of time (1 meter forward, 1 meter to the right, etc) and then try to drive that route.
            We'll mark a few sample routes on the ground with tape so we can see how accurately our robots are tracking their position.

          <h2>Month 5: Dead Reckoning + Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
          <p>
            By combining our last two features we can set a destination where want to end up and avoid obstacles along the way.
            We'll have to find our way back onto the desired path when we avoid obstacles.
            We'll try to setup various courses of a pre-planned path with some obstacles in the path to see how well we can correct around the obstacles.

          <h2>Month 6: Computer Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Dead reckoning is always subject to "sensor drift" where the accuracy of our current position becomes worse and worse the farther we drive.
            In order to correct our estimates we will use an external camera to watch the robots and give its own position estimates from time to time.
            This month we'll be focused on getting a camera to see the robots and provide an estimate of their location.
            <br />
            <small>Note: This part of the schedule might change a lot. Some members of the group might want to suggest alternate ways of correcting our location or mounting cameras on the robots rather than having a separate camera watch the robots.</small>

          <h2>Month 7: Dead Reckoning + Computer Vision + Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we have a new way to help us track our position we'll go back and try to do some more courses where we have a planned destination with obstacles in the way.
            Hopefully we can get to our desired destinations much more accurately than we did with just dead reckoning and obstacle avoidance.

          <h2>Month 8: Drawing Device</h2>
          <p>
            Before we can draw with our GoghBots we will need to have some sort of drawing tool that we can control from code.
            Hopefully it can be simple, but more reliable and precise than <a href="https://youtu.be/s-rUZIwkI-o">this drawing robot</a>.
            I'm imagining a servo that pushes a piece of sidewalk chalk on the ground so it can be easily raised and lowered.
            We might need some help from 3D printing friends to build something for us.

          <h2>Month 9: Drawing Shapes &amp; Planning for the Future</h2>
          <p>
            We'll get together and have our GoghBots draw some geometric shapes using our new drawing devices in conjunction with our motion tracking from the last several months.
            We can use pre-planned routes to create the geometic shapes.
            <br/><br />
            We'll try to measure how accurate our robots are at this point and come up with future plans for what we want to be able to draw and what improvements we'll need in order to that.
