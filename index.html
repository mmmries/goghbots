          <p>
            We will have monthly meetups to share ideas and check on our progress.
            Each month will have an intermediate goal that we are hoping to demo for our goghbots.
            These plans are all tentative. We can speed up or slow down the schedule based on whether we are accomplishing the goals.

          <h2>Month 1: Assembly</h2>
          <p>
            Let's make get a basic rolling chassis with some sort of code loaded on it.
            If you are using the suggested starter kit this will mostly involve burning an SD card and getting an ssh terminal running on the raspberry pi.
            If you are doing your own robot design there might be a lot more work involved with getting a rolling chassis that you can run code on.

          <h2>Month 2: Remote Control</h2>
          <p>
            The goal here is to make sure we have code that can drive our robot at varying speeds and varying degrees of turn.
            The simplest way to experiment with this is to allow the robot to be driven remotely by a person.
            You can control it from a keyboard, by mouse movement, by gamepad or any other input device you want.

          <h2>Month 3: Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
          <p>
            Let's use some onboard sensors to avoid getting stuck.
            Our robots won't have any specific destination in mind, they should just be wandering and trying to avoid obstacles as they go.
            We'll use something like <a href="https://youtu.be/AkhHkr1Z7WM">a roombots maze</a> to  provide examples of obstacles.
            If there are othe obstacles you want to plan for please bring your own examples and we'll se what we can learn.

          <h2>Month 4: Dead Reckoning</h2>
          <p>
            We'll use some onboard sensors to try to track our own position.
            One way to test this is to plan a route ahead of time (1 meter forward, 1 meter to the right, etc) and then try to drive that route.
            We'll mark a few sample routes on the ground with tape so we can see how accurately our robots are tracking their position.
